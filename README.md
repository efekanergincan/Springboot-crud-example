# Springboot-crud-example
This is a basic restful CRUD api using spring boot,MySql, JPA, Hibernate.
This program is about writing your lesson and lesson points. I used POSTMAN application to make requests. 
With CRUD requests i can arrange the lesson names and related points of the lessons to the database.
